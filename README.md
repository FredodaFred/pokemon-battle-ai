### Goal: Create an AI that can replicate the decisions of a Pokemon Trainer

# Methods

## RBES (Rules Based Expert System)

We used a series of production rules based on knowledge of the game of Pokemon to make an inference engine
Our Inference Engine:<br/>
Uses its knowledge of a pokemon’s moves and current status effects to model the decision making of a Pokemon Trainer
Scores each of its current Pokemon’s move options
Chooses the highest scoring move option to use to against opponent
Recommends the highest scoring move to the Pokemon Trainer each turn in battle
Data Used: Pokemon Database, Pokemon Moves Database, Pokemon Battle Damage Calculation Formulas
